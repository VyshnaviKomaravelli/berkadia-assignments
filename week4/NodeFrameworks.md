NODE FRAMEWORKS:
A Node.js framework is just some abstract design, built out of Node.js, that embodies the control flow of the given framework’s design.
So it is almost like the skeleton of a program whereby the customised codes you write kind of makes up as the meat that completes the program.

1. AdonisJs [GitHub Stars: 5,053]:
"AdonisJs is a Node.js MVC framework that runs on all major operating systems. It offers a stable ecosystem to write a server-side web application so that you can focus on business needs over finalising which package to choose or not."

2. Express.js [GitHub Stars: 41,036]:
Express.js is a fast, non-opinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. It is simply a technology built on Node.js which behaves like a middleware to help manage our servers and routes. Looking at the asynchronous nature of Node.js and the fact that Express.js was built on node, the ability to build a light-weight application that can process more than a single request seamlessly actually depends on the serving capability of technologies like express.

3. Meteor.js [GitHub Stars: 40,490]:
The Meteor docs defines meteor as a full-stack JavaScript platform for developing modern web and mobile applications. It’s major advantage is it’s realtime update. As changes are made to the web app, it automatically updates the template with the latest changes.

4. Nest.js [GitHub Stars: 10,128]:
It is used for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. Nest uses progressive JavaScript and is written with TypeScript. Being built with TypeScript means that Nest comes with strong typing and combines elements of OOP(Object Oriented Programming), FP(Functional Programming) and FRP(Functional Reactive Programming).
Nest also makes use of Express, It provides an out of the box application architecture which allows for the effortless creation of highly testable, scalable, loosely coupled, and easily maintainable applications.

5. Sails.js [GitHub Stars: 19,887]:
According to the official site, Sails is another Node.js framework used to build custom enterprise-grade Node.js apps. It boasts of being the most popular MVC Node.js framework with the support for modern apps requirements. The APIs are data-driven, with a scalable service oriented architecture.

6. Koa.js [GitHub Stars: 23,902]:
Koa is unique in the fact that it uses some really cool ECMAScript(ES6) methods that have not even landed in some browsers yet, it allows you to work without callbacks, while also providing you with an immense increase in error handling. it requires a Node.js version of at least 0.11 or higher.
According to the website, Koa does not bundle any middleware within core, meaning the middlewares are more cascaded/streamlined, and every line of code is quite elegant and granular, thereby allowing you to structure the parts however you want(component-based middlewares). This makes the framework to have more control over configurations and handling.
Koa became futureproof owing to the fact that it could actually ditch the holy grail of asynchronous functionality: callbacks.

7.LoopBack.js [GitHub Stars: 11,985]:
LoopBack is another Node.js framework with an easy-to-use CLI and a dynamic API explorer. It allows you to create your models based on your schema or dynamic models in the absence of a schema. It is compatible with a good number of REST services and a wide variety of databases including MySQL, Oracle, MongoDB, Postgres and so on.

8. Hapi.js [GitHub Stars: 10,371]:
Just like ExpressJs, the common hapi.js(supported by Walmart Labs) is a Node.js framework that helps serve data by intermediating between the server side and client. It is quite a good substitute for Express(they both have their unique features).
Hapi is a configuration-driven pattern, traditionally modeled to control web server operations. A unique feature it has is the ability to create a server on a specific IP, with features like the ‘onPreHandler’, we can do something with a request before it is completed by intercepting it and doing some pre-processing on the request.

9. Derby.js [4,350]:
According to the Derby.js site, it is a full stack Node.js framework for writing modern web applications. Derby has been around a little while, quite long enough to have proven itself to hop into 2019 and rock some chords. 

10. Total.js [Github stars: 3,853]:
Total.js boast of being a very fast development Node.js framework, that requires little maintenance, with a good performance and a seamless scaling transition. It shows some promise by giving some insight on their website, where they ask for visitors willing to contribute to the growth of the framework. So far the Total.js team has spent some time trying to get more premium sponsors to join them. This is another indication that they have plans to expand and should be checked out for more growth in the nearest future to come.
