DDOS ATTACK:
A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt normal traffic of a targeted server, 
service or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic.
DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness by utilizing multiple compromised computer systems as sources of attack traffic.
Exploited machines can include computers and other networked resources such as IoT devices.
From a high level, a DDoS attack is like a traffic jam clogging up with highway, preventing regular traffic from arriving at its desired destination.

TYPES OF DDOS ATTACKS:
1.Application Layer Attacks
2.Protocol Attacks
3.Volumetric Attacks

MITIGATION STRATEGIES OF DDOS ATTACKS:
1.Black Hole Routing
2.Rate Limiting
3.Web Application Firewall
