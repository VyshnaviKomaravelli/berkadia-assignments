-->Monolithic Architecture:

A monolithic application describes a single-tiered software application in which the user interface and data access code are combined into a single program from a single platform. A monolithic application is self-contained, and independent from other computing applications.	


*Gets bigger and bigger over iterations, and becomes difficult to manage and takes really long to startup, if the application is too big.
*Continues deployment becomes difficult, as a small change to a component in the application, requires redeployment of the entire application
*Scaling of application requires entire application scaling(ie: to launch multiple instances of the big monolithic application to serve the need), even though only one small part of the application is resource intensive.


-->MicroService based Architecture:

Microservices are a software development techniqueâ€”a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight.


*The size will remain substantially smaller, as each component is dissected to smaller services.
*Continues deployment is possible here, as each service can be deployed independent of each other.
*Scaling of individual component is possible here, as each different component is de-coupled to different services, and can be scaled up horizontally and individually.
