//FILTER:
//Filter let you provide a callback for every element and returns a filtered array.filter does not update the existing array it will return a new filtered array every time.
//MAP:The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
//REDUCE:reduce method of the array object is used to reduce the array to one single value.
//EG:
var sample = [1, 2, 3]
var result = sample.filter(elem => elem !== 2)
console.log(result)
let mapped = sample.map(elem => elem * 10)
console.log(mapped);
var sum = sample.reduce((sum, elem) => sum + elem)
console.log(sum)

//The filter() method creates an array filled with all array elements that pass a test implemented by the provided function. The filter method is well suited for particular instances where the user must identify certain items in an array that share a common characteristic.
//where as,The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element. The map method allows items in an array to be manipulated to the userâ€™s preference, returning the conclusion of the chosen manipulation in an entirely new array.
